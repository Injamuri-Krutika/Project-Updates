                <p>Results: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-f01VlNDFrwoa-BftHZ6OeMY3N7eZAGw" target="blank">PDFs of the Results</a></p>

                <h5> What was done?</h5>
                <p>The task was divided into three parts</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Investigation of fMRI RDMs</li>
                      <li>Investigation of MEG RDMs with mean across the Time points (20)</li>
                      <li>Investigation of MEG RDMs with maximum and minimum of RDMs across the Time points</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Now lets see, what was done in each one of them and what were the results.</p>
                <ul>
                    <b><li>fMRI Investigation:</li></b>
                    <ul>
                      <li><u>Experiment conducted:</u></li>
                      <p>For each of the 15 subjects, we have considered the 10 most similar image pairs (10 least RMD values)
                        and 10 most dissimilar pairs (10 highest RDM values)
                      </p>
                      <li><u>Observations:</u></li>
                      <p>There are no major observations in fMRI RDMs investigation. The image pairs are different for different subjects.
                        Very few sceneraies, mokey faces, human faces are paired.
                      </p>
                    </ul>
                    <b><li>MEG Investigation with mean:</li></b>
                    <ul>
                      <li><u>Experiment conducted:</u></li>
                      <p>For each of the 15 subjects,the mean of RDMs was taken across the 20 Time points.
                        Then, we have considered the 10 most similar image pairs (10 least RMD values)
                        and 10 most dissimilar pairs (10 highest RDM values)
                      </p>
                      <li><u>Observations:</u></li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><i>MEG Early for 92 images:</i></li>
                        <p>All the subjects show almost similar results with a very littele variations in the RDM values.
                          Few of the similiar images have same shape.
                        </p>
                        <li><i>MEG Late for 92 images:</i></li>
                        <p>Face pairs have lower RDM values. The image pairs for higher RDMS are also the same for all subjects.</p>
                        <li><i>MEG Early for 118 images:</i></li>
                        <p>Almost all the subjects have same image pairs. They have same shape.</p>
                        <li><i>MEG Late for 118 images:</i></li>
                        <p>Machines, Means of transport, animals are paired together.The background of few image pairs are also similar.</p>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <b><li>MEG Investigation with max and min:</li></b>
                    <ul>
                      <li><u>Experiment conducted:</u></li>
                      <p>For each of the 15 subjects, for the similar image pairs, an RDM(say "Min RDM") is created with lowest values across the time points. 
                        And for dissimilar image pairs, another RDM(say "Max RDM") is created with highest values across the time points.
                        Then, we have considered the 10 most similar image pairs (10 least RMD values from "Min RDM")
                        and 10 most dissimilar pairs (10 highest RDM values from "Max RDM")
                      </p>
                      <li><u>Observations:</u></li>
                      Similar to the observations in MEG with mean, all the subjects have almost same pairs.
                      <ul>
                        <li><i>MEG Early 92 images:</i></li>
                        Images with similar faces, shapes , scenes were paired.
                        <li><i>MEG Late 92 images:</i></li>
                        Human and dog faces were paired.
                        <li><i>MEG Early 118 images:</i></li>
                        Few of the similar image pairs have same shape. Few pairs are same as those in the MEG mean eperiment.
                        <li><i>MEG Late 118 images:</i></li>
                        It does not make much sense. All subjects have almost same image pairs.
                      </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>
